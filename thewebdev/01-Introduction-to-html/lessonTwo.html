  <h2>Characteristics of a German Shepherd:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>German shepherd dogs get along well with children and other pets if raised with them, but in keeping with their guarding instincts, they tend to be leery of strangers.</li>
    <li>The breed is considered to be smart and easy to train.</li>
    <li>Some poorly bred German shepherd dogs can be high-strung and nervous. Coupled with poor socialization and inadequate training, over guarding and aggressive behavior are risks.</li>
